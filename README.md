# Bioinformatics databases

## Background info
The following assignments were for a bioinformatics database class in which we use python to query fasta files, create an automaton dictionary trie, genome length local alignment with gap and space penalties in linear space. The class was during the first months of covid in which we just began online classes so using python to find open reading frames (ORF's) allowed us to find the spike protein of COVID through just the genetic sequence. Such a step is the first step needed gain knowledge to build vaccines to target. Such a project was quite inspiring to see practical useage of bioinformatics skills.
